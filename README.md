## üíæ Installation

Start by cloning the code from the GitHub repository. Then run ```git clone <clone link>``` in your terminal in a chosen directory. This application will need node and npm installed.

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage

To make your own high-quality README...
You can initialize this application in a code editor, e.g., VS Code, by opening the cloned repository and running ```node index.js``` in the editor's terminal window.
You can also run the same command ```node index.js``` in your desktop's terminal, as long as you are in the repository's directory.

The application will run through a series of prompts where you will include the information related to your project. You have the option to answer only the questions that apply. However, the predetermined sections will still appear, with empty contents if no information is provided(editing is described below). 

After completing the questionare, the application will create a new file in that directory called newREADME.md. This file will contain your new README with your provided responses written out in Markdown format. If you want to make any edits or additions to this file, you can open the file in your code editor or through your file explorer and make them there. You are then able to copy and paste the contents into your project's README.md file.

This application was made to be used again and again, but the newREADME.md file will be written over with the new responses each time.
